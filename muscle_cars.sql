(1, '1966', 'Shelby', 'GT350', 'The legendary 1965 Mustang Shelby GT350 were serious high- performance machines. In fact, some buyers that very first year felt these cars were a little too hardcore and at the same time Shelby was on a rampage to cut costs. So, for 1966, Shelby replaced, deleted or made optional some of the car’s signature high performance features like the adjustable Koni shocks, the fiberglass hood, free-flowing (and loud) side exhaust outlets and that fully locking Detroit Locker rear differential.\r\n\r\nLittle Known Fact: But if you checked the fine print there was a Paxton supercharger option available for 1966. The $700 option was claimed to boost the 289 cid V8’s 306 hp output by 46 percent. That’s probably a bit generous, but it was still an excellent power adder. But the supercharger cost nearly a quarter of the car’s original pricetag and just 12 customers were willing to pay.', '1966_Shelby_GT350.png'),
(2, '1968', 'Ford Mustang', 'Shelby GT500', 'The first two years of Carroll Shelby\'s Mustangs are the most desirable to many Mustang purists. Those 1965 and 1966 GT 350s were light, simply styled, and perfect for track work. But the later 1967 and 1968 cars offered more fun under the hood and were the machines of choice if you wanted to win drag races.\n\nFor the first time, \'67 to \'68 GT 500 Shelbys came with 355-hp 428-cubic-inch big-block power under the hood. Car testers of the day saw quarter-mile time slips in the mid-to-low 14-second bracket—quick for the day. The Shelby Mustangs received more scoops and flashier styling than the older cars to match the new-found power and torque. And the even quicker KR (King of the Road) high-performance model was available in 1968 too.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The 1967 Shelby Mustangs used Mercury Cougar tail lamps, but the 1968 models used lamps from the \'66 Ford Thunderbird.', '1968_Ford_Mustang_Shelby_GT500.png'),
(3, '1969 1/2', 'Dodge', 'Super Bee A12', 'The Super Bee was essentially a high-performance version of the Dodge Coronet. In 1968, the ‘Bee came standard with a 383 cid V8 or the legendary monster 426 cid Hemi. But halfway through the 1969 model year, Dodge made the 440 cid Six-Pack (three, two barrel carburetors) available. Known internally as option code A12, it wore a matte-black, lift-off fiberglass hood with a massive forward-facing scoop. The A12 Super Bee produced 390 hp and a ridiculously potent 490 lb-ft of torque. And that happened to be same torque spec as the Hemi. So, you received nearly the same thrust, in a more streetable package at a lower price, too.\n\nLittle Known Fact: The Six-Pack-equipped A12 Super Bees went through final-assembly by an outside vendor called Creative Industries in Detroit. The first 100 were built as 383 Coronets at the Chrysler Assembly Plant and then shipped to Creative for 440 Six Pack engine installation along with some of the A12-specific features. And those first 100 of these big block engines were equipped with an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifolds. After this engine received regular production status they were fitted at the plant with Chrysler-cast aluminum intakes.', '1969_half_Dodge_Super_Bee_A12.png'),
(4, '1969-1971', 'Baldwin-Motion Phase III', 'GT Corvette', 'Baldwin-Motion was the first Corvette tuner and the machines that company created were legendary. Baldwin Chevrolet, a dealer in Baldwin, NY would deliver new Corvettes to Joel Rosen’s Motion Performance speed shop down the road for modifications. Motion would build these serial production specialty Corvettes to order. It was Rosen’s dream in late-1968 to build a new, fast and functional all-American GT sports car.\n\nThe sensuously styled Phase III GT was a stunner. It had a unique fastback rear window, a performance suspension and as much as 600 dyno-tuned horsepower from either a 427 cid or 454 cid big-block V8s. Although one Motion Vette did receive a smaller LT1-spec 350 cid V8.\n\nLittle Known Fact: When the father of the Corvette, chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov caught wind of their operation—it could have been bad news for Motion. Instead, when Duntov first saw the GT at its launch at the 1969 New York International Auto Show, he gave the machine his blessing. According to Marty Schorr who worked closely with Rosen on the cars, Duntov said, “I really like your Corvette, Joel. Unfortunately, we cannot do what you do.”\n\nOnly 12 were built between 1969-1971.', '1969-1971_Baldwin-Motion_Phase_III_GT_Corvette.png'),
(5, '1969', 'AMX/3', '', 'The AMX/3 was a stunningly-cool mid-engined exotic. Its development was an international collaborative effort between an AMC team led by Dick Teague (head of design), ItalDesign, Italian engineer Giotto Bizzarrini and even some work was done by BMW. The 3,300-pound sports car was powered by an AMC 390 cid V8 that packed 340 hp and was backed by a four-speed manual. It could reportedly accelerate to 60 mph in just over 5 seconds and top 170 mph—solid numbers for the time.\n\nBut the machine never officially made it to AMC showrooms, in part because of cost. It would have required a sticker price reportedly close to $15,000 and just a few thousand dollars shy of Lamborghini’s Miura.\n\nLittle Known Fact: Six prototypes were of this car were built (plus a rumored seventh parts car) and some of them ended up in private garages. These surviving AMX/3s look more like production cars than they do prototypes. And one of them sold at an auction in 2017 for almost $900,000.', '1969_AMX_3.png'),
(6, '1984', 'Chevy', 'Corvette', 'The third generation of America\'s sports car, the Corvette, had an incredibly long run: 1968 to 1982. So when it came time for GM to launch the next-generation C4 Corvette, there was wild speculation about the car. Some predicted it would use a midengine chassis, like an Italian exotic. And others thought it might use a rotary engine, like Mazda\'s.\n\nIn the end, the next Vette wasn\'t radical. It still had a small-block Chevy V-8 up front driving the rear wheels. That first year, it cranked out a meager 205 hp. But after a switch to a new, tuned port fuel-injection system in later years, horsepower jumped—and so did performance. Five years later, Chevy debuted the first ultra-performance Vette since the 1960s: the 375-hp ZR-1.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: There is no production 1983 Corvette. Although 1982 was the last year for the third-generation Corvette, Chevy decided to wait until the 1984 model year to launch the all-new car. Why? Some sources claim tighter emissions regulations necessitated more time for development. Others say that quality glitches at the factory were the real reason. All we know is every 1983 Corvette prototype was destroyed, except one: a white car that now lives at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Ky.', '1984_Chevy_Corvette.png'),
(7, '1969', 'Dodge Charger', 'Daytona', 'The 1969 Dodge Daytona and its sibling, the 1970 Plymouth Superbird, are arguably the most radical vehicles to emerge from the muscle car wars. But the Daytona, as the name might suggest, wasn\'t designed for street racing. It was built to win Nascar races on the superspeedways—the longest and fastest tracks.\n\nTo increase top speed, engineers took the Charger to the wind tunnel. The aerodynamic modifications to the big Dodge included a nearly 2-foot-tall rear wing, a flush rear window, and a longer, sloped nose cone. The results were impressive. The race version of the Daytona became the first car in Nascar history to break 200 mph. After numerous Dodge wins in 1969 and some by Plymouth in 1970, Nascar\'s new rule book banned these cars. The production cars, which came packing a 440 big-block or the legendary 426 Hemi, are sought-after collector cars today that bring more than $150,000 at auctions.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The Daytona\'s aerodynamic modifications over a those of a standard Charger helped lower the coefficient of drag to 0.28—an excellent figure even by today\'s standards. But did that huge rear wing really need to be so tall to maximize rear-end downforce? According to legend, no. The reason for the exaggerated height of the wing was so that the trunklid on the production cars could pass underneath it and fully open.', '1969_Dodge_Charger_Daytona.png'),
(8, '1965', 'Pontiac', 'Catalina 2+2', 'The high-performance GTO version of Pontiac’s Tempest is regarded in many circles as the original muscle car and it added some serious heat to automaker’s lineup for 1964. The following year, Pontiac decided to work that same magic on it’s bigger cars by dropping a 338 hp 421 cubic-inch V8 into the all-new big body Catalina to create the 2+2 performance model. It was a terrible name but a beastly machine, especially if you spent a few more bucks and upgraded to the 421 H.O. which made 376 hp. The 2+2 famously used a wide eight-lug hubs and included a beefier suspension, bucket seats, a Hurst shifter and special badging.\n\nLittle Known Fact: The high-performance cars Pontiac supplied to the automotive press during the 1960s were sent to Royal Pontiac in Royal Oak, Michigan before landing in writer’s hands. Royal was a dealership but it was also a tuning shop that offered Pontiac-approved speed parts for its clients. And it’s likely some of the best parts ended up on these Pontiacs because the Catalina 2+2 that was tested by Car and Driver at the time could not only hit 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and charge through the ¼-mile in 13.8 seconds but it was quicker around a track than the Ferrari the magazine used in that comparison test. It’s safe to say no factory-equipped Catalina 2+2 could repeat that feat without some Royal speed parts.', '1965_Pontiac_Catalina_2_+_2.png'),
(9, '1970', 'Oldsmobile', '442', 'The 442 (which gets its name from its four-barrel carburetor, four-speed manual, and dual exhausts) was based on the Cutlass and become the hot muscle machine for the Oldsmobile division. It shared its platform with two other hot GM machines, the Chevy Chevelle SS and the Pontiac GTO. And like the GTO, the 442 was only a trim level at the beginning. But by 1970, you could get a huge 455-cubic-inch big-block V-8. And when equipped with the even more potent W30 parts, the motor made 360 hp and a whopping 500 lb-ft of torque. It could hit 60 mph in less than 6 seconds, which was very quick for the time—especially for an Olds.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: Actor James Garner raced a beefed-up 1970 Olds 442 in the NORRA Mexico 1000 (a precursor to the Baja 1000), where it won second in class. The Goodyear Grabber, as it was known, was built by legendary Baja-race-vehicle guru Vic Hickey and sponsored by Goodyear tires. The vehicle was recently restored and put up for sale.', '1970_Oldsmobile_442.png'),
(10, '1978', 'Pontiac Firebird', 'Trans Am', 'By the late 1970s, muscle car performance was a mere shadow of what it had been years earlier. The latest emissions controls, combined with high gas prices and stratospheric insurance costs, caused most automakers to severely dial back horsepower.\n\nBut not Pontiac. The Trans-Am had been riding a new wave of popularity since its starring role in the movie Smokey and the Bandit. For the 1978 model year, Pontiac added to the excitement by actually increasing the horsepower of its top-level Trans Am from 200 to 220. The brand also developed a special handling package called the WS6 that added a sport-tuned suspension, wider 8-inch wheels, new tires, and quicker steering. The result was a Pontiac Trans-Am that was actually quicker and handled better around a track than the Chevy Corvette.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The Pontiac\'s T-top roof, which first became an option in 1976, was as close as a buyer could get to a convertible Trans Am. These lift-out roof sections were initially made by Hurst and were known as the Hurst Hatch. The problem was, they leaked. This led Pontiac to develop its own T-tops within GM\'s Fisher body division and launch the option midway through the 1978 model year. So some \'78 Firebirds have Hurst T-tops and others have the Fisher units. You can spot the difference because the Fisher glass roof panels are larger than the Hurst Hatch ones.', '1978_Pontiac_Firebird_Trans_Am.png'),
(11, '1969', 'Ford Mustang', 'Boss 429', 'In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Nascar was in its golden age. Automakers took the business of stock-car racing seriously and would dream up engines and bodywork for racing that were often too wild for the street. All the automakers needed to do was sell 500 of these radical cars and they could run them in Nascar.\n\nThe Boss 429 Mustang was just such a beast. Although the Mustang didn\'t compete in Nascar, the 375-hp 429-cubic-inch V-8 under its hood was designed specifically for racing and built to rev to 6000 rpm. The problem was, this motor did not perform well on the street. It was slower than the other big-block Mustangs at the time. The Nascar-bound V-8 was monstrously large and did not fit in a stock Mustang\'s engine bay. So Ford contracted Kar Kraft in Brighton, Mich., to handle the job. The company relocated the shock towers, widened the track of the front end using unique componentry, relocated the battery to the trunk, and fitted a smaller brake booster—all to make room for this beastly powerplant to fit in the Mustang. Today, the rarity and mystique behind the Boss 429 has pushed values at auction well beyond $200,000.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: There were actually three different 429 engines installed in the Boss 429 between \'69 and \'70. The hardcore \"S-Code\" was installed in early cars and filled with race-duty parts. But the S-Code had warranty problems, reportedly because of an incorrect assembly process. So the \"T-Code\" with lighter-duty parts was used in some cars. The later \"A-Code\" version of the 429, equipped with smog equipment and a new valvetrain, appeared toward the end of production.', '1969_Ford_Mustang_Boss_429.png'),
(12, '1970', 'Chevy Chevelle', 'LS6', 'When GM relaxed its longstanding rule forbidding engines larger than 400 cubic inches to be installed in midsize cars, it set off a muscle frenzy across the company\'s divisions. Oldsmobile put the huge 455-cubic-inch into its 442, and Chevy installed a unique 454-cubic-inch V-8, the LS6, into its Chevelle SS.\n\nA conservative estimate of the LS6\'s power puts it at 450 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. But thanks to its high 11.25:1 compression ratio and giant Holley 780 CFM carb, the LS6\'s real output in the Chevelle SS was closer to 500 hp, many experts claim. Our pals at Car and Driver tested one in 1970 and found it hit 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds, running through the quarter-mile in 13.8 seconds. And that was with the skinny low-grip tires of the day; that same car with modern rubber would be much quicker. The LS6 carries the highest factory horsepower rating of all muscle cars.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The Chevrolet Corvette has always been Chevy\'s top performance car. And up until the LS6, GM wouldn\'t allow any other Chevy to carry a horsepower rating higher than that of the Corvette. But somehow that stance was relaxed for 1970—the highest horsepower engine you could get in a 1970 Corvette was a 390-hp LS5 454. An LS7 was planned with 465 hp, but it was never officially sold. So why no LS6? An LS6 Corvette was offered for 1971, but its potency slipped (at least officially) to 425 hp.', '1970_Chevy_Chevelle_LS6.png'),
(13, '1969', 'Pontiac', 'GTO Judge', 'Pontiac owned the muscle scene in the early 1960s. In fact, the 1964 Pontiac GTO is widely regarded as the very first of the breed. But by 1968, that car had plenty of competition. The thought within Pontiac was to make a cheaper version of the GTO with a smaller 350-cubic-inch engine called the ET (for \"elapsed time\") a drag-racing term.\n\nPontiac boss John DeLorean didn\'t like that idea. To him, no GTO could have an engine that small. Instead, the team built a car one step up from the regular GTO. DeLorean himself named the car after a popular skit on the TV show Rowan and Martin\'s Laugh-In. The Judge featured the 360-hp Ram Air III engine standard, but buyers could also opt for the more hardcore 370-hp Ram Air IV. The rarest of all were the GTO Judge Ram Air IV convertibles—only five were built in 1969.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The original TV commercial for the Judge featured the rock band Paul Revere and the Raiders singing about the GTO out on a dry lakebed. According to the book Pontiac Pizazz, by Jim Wangers and Art Fitzpatrick, the lead singer, Mark Lindsay, was a car guy and loved the Judge, so he wrote a song about it. Wangers claims this commercial is considered one of the earliest rock-music videos.', '1969_pontiac_GTO_Judge.png'),
(14, '1969', 'COPO', 'Camaro', 'Chevrolet\'s Central Office Production Order (COPO) system was designed for fleet sales; it was intended to spec out heavy-duty suspensions for cop cars and stain-proof interiors for taxicabs. But enterprising dealers with the right connections, such as Yenko Chevrolet in Pennsylvania, figured out that Camaros could be ordered this way, too. And given the right order codes, the dealer could spec out a fire-breathing monster of a Camaro that Chevy didn\'t really want you to own.\n\nThe production order 9561 specified a 427 big-block V-8 rated at 425 hp—just like a Vette. But the even rarer COPO 9560 called for an all-aluminum ZL-1 427 V-8. Though this engine was rated with just 5 more hp, it was widely known that this race-spec engine delivered more like 550 hp. Only 69 ZL-1 Camaros were built, and these cars command prices in the $400,000 range at an auction\n\nLittle-Known Fact: The aluminum ZL-1 427 V-8 in the 9560 COPO Camaro is essentially a race engine. Chevy originally developed this 427 motor for the Chaparral racing team to use in the Can Am series. There are no external emblems on a ZL-1 Camaro that let you know what\'s under the hood—only plain-vanilla Camaro badges.', '1969_COPO_Camaro.png'),
(15, '1987', 'Buick', 'GNX', 'Long after the big block V-8-powered muscle cars of the 1960s and 1970s went, Buick brought back some of that magic in the 1980s. The Buick GNX, based on the Grand National (which is itself a hot-rod version of the Regal coupe), was equipped with a potent, turbocharged V-6. The GNX package brought the Grand National\'s horsepower from 245 up to 276. Car and Driver tested one in 1987 and recorded a 0-to-60-mph time of just 4.6 seconds, making it one of the quickest cars on the market. Buick made only 547 of these black beasts. Many were squirreled away into storage as investments.\n\nLittle-Known Fact: Buick had quite a few of these engines left over when it stopped production of the GNX—so Pontiac picked up the turbo V-6s and put them in the 1989 20th Anniversary Trans Am. It was conservatively rated at just 250 hp, but true GM enthusiasts knew the potential that lay under the hood of that Trans Am.', '1987_Buick_GNX.png'),
(16, '1967', 'Chevrolet Camaro', 'Z28', 'Designed for Trans-Am racing, the Chevy Camaro Z28 won the Trans-Am Championship in 1968 and 1969, helping \"Z28\" become the most famous regular production code in Chevrolet history. Only 602 Chevrolet Camaro Z28s were sold in 1967, and the vehicle came with 15-inch rally wheels.', '1967_Chevrolet_Camaro_Z28.png'),
(17, '1968', 'Plymouth', 'Road Runner', 'The Plymouth Road Runner was Chrysler\'s attempt to offer car buyers a simple, affordable muscle car just as muscle cars were starting to get expensive. Named after the Road Runner of \"Looney Tunes\" fame, this high-performance car contained Chrysler\'s famous 7-liter, 426-cubic-inch Hemi V8 engine.', '1968_Plymouth_Road_Runner.png'),
(18, '1968', 'Dodge Dart', '426 Hemi', 'Part of the fourth generation of Dodge Darts, a car that lasted from 1958 to 1976, the 1968 Dodge Dart 426 Hemi was designed exclusively for drag racing, and only 80 were released. This muscle car could reach quarter-mile runs in just 10 seconds, making it one of the fastest factory vehicles of its era.', '1968_Dodge_Dart_426_Hemi.png'),
(19, '1969', 'Chevrolet Camaro', 'ZL1', 'A legendary American muscle car, the 1969 Camaro ZL1 contained Chevrolet\'s 427 V8 engine, the company\'s most powerful engine at the time and capable of 430 horsepower. Very few Camaro ZL1s were produced, making it a precious collectible.', '1969_Chevrolet_Camaro_ZL1.png'),
(20, '1970', 'Ford Torino', 'Cobra', 'Motor Trend\'s Car of the Year in 1970, the 1970 Ford Torina Cobra reached 60 mph in just under six seconds and boasted a powerful V8 engine with 370 horsepower. Buyers could get a variant of the Cobra with a three- or four-speed manual transmission.', '1970_Ford_Torino_Cobra.png'),
(21, '1970', 'Buick', 'GSX', 'Built as a rival to the Pontiac GTO Judge, Oldsmobile 442 and Chevy Chevelle SS, the 1970 Buick GSX was a variant of the famous Gran Sport line of Buick muscle cars. The Buick GSX emphasized luxury alongside performance, and only 687 GSXs were built, making the vehicle a collectible.', '1970_Buick_GSX.png'),
(22, '1970', 'Plymouth', 'Barracuda', 'The Plymouth Barracuda saga began in 1964 as a fastback coupe based on the Valiant. The first-generation Barracuda was mostly famous for its distinctive wraparound rear glass, but also for being Plymouth’s first sporty, compact vehicle or \"pony car.\" No match for the popular Ford Mustang, the Barracuda was redesigned for 1967, when notchback and convertible versions joined the already familiar fastback. Although still Valiant-based, the second-gen Barracuda received new sheet metal and larger engines, including Chrysler’s 7.2-liter, 440 Commando V-8 and the 7.0-liter, HEMI 426 V-8. The Barracuda reached its popularity peak in the early 1970s, as the heavily redesigned, third-generation model joined the muscle car wars. Longer and wider, the 1970 Barracuda renounced its Valiant roots and adopted an image of its own, while sitting on Chrysler’s new E-body platform.\n\nThe third-gen Barracuda also marked the demise of Plymouth’s main weapon against the Ford Mustang. As the oil crisis struck and compression ratios were reduced in performance engines, the nameplate died altogether after the 1974 model year. Fortunately enough, the short-lived HEMI Cuda, sold only in 1970 and 1971, made a huge impact in the muscle car world, enabling the Barracuda moniker to sit alongside the like of the Mustang, Camaro and Challenger at the top of the pony car kingdom. Although the original HEMI died 50 years ago and Plymouth got the axe in 2001, the HEMI Cuda lives on as one of America’s most prized collectible car. Read on to find out what makes the Cuda a special muscle car.', '1970_Plymouth_Barracuda.png'),
(23, '1970', 'Dodge', 'Challenger', 'Based on the Barracuda, the 1970 Dodge Challenger from Chrysler also featured the E-body platform. This vehicle had a long wheelbase and luxurious interior, and it was built as an upscale response to the more sparsely equipped Ford Mustang that was popular in the U.S. at the time.', '1970_1974_Dodge_Challenger_First_Generation.png'),
(29, '1984', 'Ferrari', '308 GTS Quattrovalvole', 'The 308 had a tube frame with separate body. The 308 GTB/GTS and GT4 were mechanically similar, and also shared much with the original Dino. Both 308s sit on the same tube platform, however the GT4—being a 2+2—has a longer wheelbase. The engine was a V8 of a 90 degree configuration, with two belt-driven overhead camshafts per cylinder bank. It was transversely mounted in unit with the transaxle transmission assembly, which was below and to the rear of the engine\'s sump. All models used a fully synchromesh[2] 5-speed \"dog-leg\" manual gearbox and a clutch-type limited slip differential. Suspension was all-independent, comprising double wishbones, coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers, and anti-roll bars on both axles; four wheel vented disc brakes were also fitted. Steering was unassisted rack and pinion.\n\nThe 308\'s body was designed by Pininfarina\'s Leonardo Fioravanti, who had been responsible for some of Ferrari\'s most celebrated shapes to date such as the Daytona, the Dino and the Berlinetta Boxer. The 308 used elements of these shapes to create something very much in contrast with the angular Bertone-designed GT4. GTS models featured a removable roof panel with grained satin black finish, which could be stowed in a vinyl cover behind the seats when not in use.', '1984_Ferrari_308_GTS_Quattrovalvole.png'),
(30, '1978', 'Chevrolet', 'Corvette', '1978 was the Corvette\'s twenty–fifth anniversary, and all 78\'s featured silver anniversary nose and fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window was the most dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the ten-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. A shade was installed that could be pulled forward to cover the rear compartment to protect cargo and carpet against the unrelenting sun. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new “aircraft styled” center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new as well as an actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years. Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio.[6] The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side vanity mirror was an upgraded illuminated unit. The base L-48 engine generated 185 hp (138 kW); Those destined for California or high altitude areas produced 175 hp (130 kW). Gone was the chrome-plated ignition shielding over the distributor, replaced with a metal-lined black plastic unit. The single-snorkel air intake used since 1976 was changed to a dual-snorkel set-up on L-82 equipped cars helping to boost that output to 220 hp (164 kW). L-82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold which saved 24 pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required fender trimming from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 gal to 24 gal on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.\n\nTwo special editions were offered to celebrate Corvette\'s 25th year. Before he retired, Bill Mitchell had suggested a Silver Anniversary model in his favorite color-silver, appropriately enough-and it appeared as the $399 B2Z option package. The first two-tone paint option offered since 1961, it presented silver over a gray lower body with a separating pinstripe, plus aluminum wheels and dual \"sport\" outside mirrors as mandatory options, which added another $380 to the cost. 6502 Indy-500 Pace car replica editions were produced featuring Black/silver two-tone paint, front and rear spoilers, mirror-tint roof panels and contoured sport seats. Reviewers praised the car\'s classic strengths including its impressive straight-line numbers, especially an L48/automatic\'s 7.8 second 0-60 time and top speed of 123 mph (198 km/h), and noted its more refined, less rattling ride. On the other hand, they continued to note its weaknesses, like a rear-end that tended to step out during sharp maneuvers and a cabin that was still cramped and uncomfortable.\n\nRoad & Track took a 1978 L82 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in just 6.6 seconds, 127 mph (204 km/h) flat out, and covered the quarter-mile in 15.3 seconds @ 95 mph.[33]\n\n1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on the nose and fuel door revert to those seen on the \'77 model. Three popular features introduced on the \'78 pace car replicas made it into this year\'s production: the new bucket seats, the front and rear spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24 pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard anti-theft alarm system. Tungsten-halogen high-beam headlights became standard as did an AM-FM radio, and for the first time a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option.[34] Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension. An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning.[35] Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black.[32] Output for all engines increased due to new \"open flow\" mufflers. The dual-snorkel air intake introduced on L-82 cars the previous year was now fitted to all cars and the base engine now generated 195 hp (145 kW). The optional L-82 engine increased to 225 hp (168 kW). This was the final year a manual gearbox could be ordered with the L-82 engine. This was also the last year for the M21 close-ratio 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine.[15] A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In \'79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes.[6] This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.', '1978_chevrolet_corvette.png'),
(31, '1959', 'Pontiac', 'Bonneville', 'The Sport Coupe was one of four models in Pontiac’s prestigious, top-of-the-line Bonneville line-up during 1959.\n\nHaving become it’s own series the previous year, the Bonneville was completely redesigned along with all the other Pontiacs for the the 1959 model year.\n\nIt was the year that saw the introduction of the split grille which went on to become one of Pontiac’s distinguishing features for a decade. It’s something you didn’t see on the 1960 models though as they were designed before they realised what a hit they had on their hands.\n\nAnother twin was seen at the rear of the car with the new “V” tail-fin design.\n\nInside, this Bonneville enjoys all-Morrokide vinyl three-tone uphostery. This tri-color styling was used across all Pontiacs with them using this luxurious look for many years to come.\n\nInstrument panels were also redesigned using three large guages mounted inside a raised pod in front of the driver. A Bonneville script was also used in these models and found next to the padded handrail assist bar.\n\nEngine size was also increased for 1959 with all models receiving a 389 cubic inch V8 with five power variants available. The Bonneville came with a 260 horsepower engine with 4-barrel carburetor as standard.\n\nAll came with a 3-speed manual transmission as standard with a Super Hydra-matic automatic transmission available as a $231 option.\n\nThe original owner of this Bonneville opted for a tri-power setup that used three, 2-barrel carburetors and had a total output of 315 horsepower. This cost an additional $143. They also chose to pair it with the Super Hydra-matic. Other options on this car include power steering and power brakes costing $108 and $43 respectively.\n\nIf you had ordered a Bonneville Sports Coupe during the 1959 model year then the base price would have been $3,257 with Pontiac managing to sell 27,769 of them. Total Bonneville sales that year were 82,564.', '1959_pontiac_bonneville.png'),
(32, '1969', 'Chevrolet Chevelle', 'SS 396', 'Chevelles of the late sixties always prove popular but the 1969 SS 396 Sport Coupe is a firm favorite with many people. Seen here in LeMans Blue (code 71) it looks both gorgeous and a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe look of the ’69 Chevelle Malibu didn’t change much from the previous year. The new models were easy to spot as the deletion of the vent windows gave the car a cleaner look. (Note: The 300 Deluxe models retained the vent windows)\n\n1969 saw the Super Sport now back to being an optional package rather than a model in its own right. This meant that, for this year only, you could have bought a SS 396 2-door post sedan. The total cost of the SS package was $347.60.\n\nInside, the parchment vinyl interior looks fantastic and complements the exterior color perfectly. Even the original AM radio (a $61 option) still works.\n\nThe steering wheel, dash and door panels all have SS identification to highlight the package. The only exception was the 2-door sedan which, because of retaining the vent window, needed different door panels so didn’t get the badge.\n\nUnder the hood sits the mighty 396 cubic inch V8 that delivers 325 horsepower. On this car it’s paired with a Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission – a $222 option when the car was ordered new (a 3-speed manual was standard). To help stop that power, the SS package came with power disc brakes.\n\nA 1969 model Chevelle Malibu Sport Coupe would have cost you $2,601 if you had ordered one originally, plus the cost of the SS package.', '1969_chevrolet_chevelle_ss396.png'),
(33, '1973', 'Dodge', 'Challenger', 'Around since 1970, the Challenger was Dodge’s answer to Chevrolet’s Camaro and Pontiac’s Firebird and shared the Chrysler E-body with the Plymouth Barracuda.\n\nFor 1973, not much had changed to the look of the Challenger from the 72 models. Identification is easy from the front with its changed grille insert and big bumper guards that were introduced to satisfy the new safety regulations.\n\nSeen here in desirable light metallic green paint (GF3), this Challenger has been restored and looks great inside and out.\n\nDescribed by Dodge as a personal sports compact, the 110 inch wheelbase E-body challenger was still pretty big at 198.2 inches.\n\nInside ’73 challengers you’d find all-vinyl bucket seats with integral head restraints – seen here in green but also available in black, blue or white. Note the ultra cool pistol grip shifter.\n\nOther standard equipment included; deep-pile carpeting, simulated wood-grained door inserts, keyless door locking system, front and rear armrests, dome light and day / night inside mirror.\n\nUnder the hood sits a 318 cubic inch V8 that generates 150 horsepower – it was the base engine now with the slant six being dropped in the Challenger lineup for 1973.\n\nThis particular Challenger enjoys such options as power brakes, power steering and air conditioning.\n\nDodge managed to sell 32,596 Challengers for the 1973 model year at a base price of $3,011. This was nearly 6,000 more of them sold than the previous year.', '1973_dodge_challenger.png'),
(34, '1973', 'Dodge Coronet', '383 CU 4 Door', 'When it first came out back in 1971, this model of a Dodge Coronet featured four V-8 engines and only one with six cylinders telling you that this car will be a great ride.\n\nThe one in question is in this specimen is the 383 big block or so called wedge engine, due to the way the combustion chamber is formed.\n\nThat means that this 47 year old machine means business and that is obvious after you take a close look at it.\n\nNobody would bet against it and the only thing holding it back is the fact that this is the first time ever this car is at the track, making a pass, meaning that there are tons of things that could be tweaked for a better result in the future.\n\nAnd it seems that they are not off by a lot because this thing put down a great pass, showing that Japanese sedan that it still punches a kick, so check it out.', '1973_4_Door_Dodge Coronet_383_CU.png'),
(35, '1970', 'Cougar Eliminator', 'Boss 302', 'The 1st Generation Mercury Cougar launched in 1967 as the car slotted in between the Mustang and Thunderbird. While the Cougar was mechanically the same as the Mustang with similar performance in all trims, it was often overshadowed by the cheaper Mustang. This has also made the Cougar a more rare car.\n\nIn 1969, Ford introduced the Boss 302 Mustang that was available from factory which was wildly popular with an underrated \"290hp\" coming from it\'s high-revving V8, and visual upgrades such as the eye catching colors, matte black front spoiler, rear spoiler, and hoodscoop as well as that really cool Boss 302 graphic on the sides of the car.\n\nOn the Mercury side, they didn\'t have a straight cut model like the Boss 302. Instead they had packages called the Eliminator Equipment and Eliminator Decor Group package that had be special ordered by first ordering a base model Cougar hardtop coupe. This option came with limited color options: Bright Blue, Competition Orange, Yellow and White. Other colors could be specially ordered but no records show that any other colors were selected. Other things included were the Eliminator Graphic, a front and rear spoiler, blacked out grille and a hood scoop (the hood scoop was only functional if the ram air option was picked with Cobra Jet 428 engine). The interior had a unique gauge cluster, highback bucket seats, a Rim Blow steering wheel as well as other small changes.\n\nPower wise, the Cougar Eliminator base engine was the 290hp 351 Windsor. Other options were the 320hp 390 V8, and the \"335hp\" 428CJ, and the 428SJ engine. The engine in question though is the Boss 302 engine. It wasn\'t an option until later in 1969. The Boss 302 also had it\'s own stipulations because this option could only be paired with a 4-speed manual transmission. Because of how late the 302 option became available, dealers probably didn\'t know it was available for the Cougar Eliminator and thus, only 169 Cougar Boss 302 Eliminators were made in 1969. In 1970 only 469 Mercury Cougar Boss 302 Eliminators were produced meaning only 638 of the 2,250 Cougar Eliminators were Boss 302s making them extremely rare.', '1970_Cougar_Eliminator_Boss_302.png');
